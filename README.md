## Description
This is an example web application demonstrating the CRUD routes using the Node.js platform, Express.js and MongoDB.
The application is accompanied by walkthrough slides and presented to the [San Diego JavaScript](http://sandiegojs.org/)
Fundamental JS group. The application was adapted from Scott Domes' [tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2)
and further understanding from Adnan Rahic's [tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-design-with-node-js-26ccf66eab09).
## Getting Started
The following are required to be installed on your local machine for this guide:
* Node - http://nodejs.org
* An mLab account to set up a sandbox mongodb database - http://mlab.com (instructions for setting up the database can be found in the tutorial by Scott Domes linked above)

*Remember to include a .gitignore file if you plan on committing the project to github*
